# Portfolio

## Portfolio creation 

I created this web portfolio using my own knowledge of HTML and CSS, with the addition of bootstrap and a small amount of JavaScript to run one of the bootstrap elements.

## Challenges
During the project I decided to combine my Five CSS files into one, this was quite the undertaking. For this process I used diff checker to compare the code, combining the files one at a time. For example the bootstrap cards that were used across multiple pages with different styles were given unique Ids or more specific selectors to keep there styles different

## What I learned

I grew to appreciate how easy in was using bootstrap, instead of creating whole cards and tables in CSS I could instead use the bootstrap template and use CSS to tweak it to my liking.
